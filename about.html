    <p>
        A person’s emotion or mood can be detected by his/her facial expressions. 
        One can get hold of these expressions in real time via a webcam. 
        A lot of research is being conducted in the field of Computer Vision and Machine Learning (ML),
        where machines are trained to identify various human emotions or moods. 
        People often use music as a means of mood regulation, specifically to change a bad mood, 
        increase energy level or reduce tension. Also, listening to the right kind of music at the right time
        may improve mental health. Thus, human emotions have a strong relationship with music.

    <h4>Current System:</h4>
<p>
 The currently available music player systems which are often embedded in our smartphones use our previous history of songs to recommend songs.
The user has to face the task of manually browsing through the playlist of songs and select songs based on his/her current mood and behaviour. 
Randomly played songs may not match the mood of the user.
<h4>Expected System:</h4>
•	A system that provides, the user with an automatically generated playlist of songs based on the current emotion and mood of the user.
<h4>SCOPE OF PROJECT AND APPLICATIONS</h4>
<p>
This system can be effectively used for personal use. It can act as a mood lifter or mood enhancer. 
This system would be helpful in music therapy treatment and provide the music therapist the help needed to 
treat the patients suffering from disorders like mental stress, anxiety, acute depression and trauma.
